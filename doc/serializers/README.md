csharp# Serializers

As I wrote into the [setup](../setup-1.md#the-serializer-package) page there are different options for the serialization but, in case you need something special, you have the opportunity to create your own serialization logic.

You can use them in a classic way or combined with your favourite dependency injection framework.

{% hint style="info" %}
In case of dependency injection, all the proposed library can be used as singleton
{% endhint %}
